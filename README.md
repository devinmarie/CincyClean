# CincyClean
We will be building a simple application for a cleaning service. The application will have the following:


## 1. Customer Facing Request Tool
The customer will select the cleaning service they would like to have done along with providing customer details. One of the details will be an address where we will utilize GeoLocation + Google APIs to provide the user an option to auto-fill in their address (Mobile Feature). The customer will agree to the total cost of services and submit their request. This request will be sent to the cleaning company (Request = Model 1). 

## 2. Company Facing Scheduling Tool

The company will see all of the requests that have been scheduled and all of the new requests that have not been scheduled. They will then select an employee (Employees = Model 2) that will be assigned to the request. 

*If multiple features are required, then we will look into possibly adding touch signature pad for the customer.*
